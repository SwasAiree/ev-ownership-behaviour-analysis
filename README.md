# ev-ownership-behaviour-analysis
Analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) ownership behaviour in Australia using Excel-based statistical techniques. Covers travel patterns, fuel savings, charging habits, and attitudes toward public EV infrastructure.

# EV Ownership Behaviour Analysis – Project

This project explores the behaviours and attitudes of electric vehicle (EV) owners in Australia, based on survey data. It was completed as part of the – Descriptive Analytics and Visualisation unit at Deakin University in Trimester 2, 2024.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To uncover key behavioural trends among EV owners and provide actionable insights for policymakers and infrastructure planners using descriptive and inferential data analysis techniques.

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

- Do metro EV owners travel more than regional ones?
- Is towing more common among regional owners?
 fuel savings differ across household types?
- Does purchase motivation affect home charging frequency?
- How does locality and trip type affect EV distance travelled?
- Has public sentiment toward EV infrastructure improved?

---

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Descriptive statistics
- Hypothesis testing (means and proportions)
- Experimental design and interaction analysis
- Paired sample t-tests (attitude index change)
- Data storytelling for non-technical stakeholders

## 📈 Key Insights from the Project

- **Metro vs Regional Driving**: Metro EV owners drive slightly more than regional ones, but the difference is not statistically significant — implying both areas require equal focus in EV infrastructure planning.

- **Towing Usage**: Both metro and regional EV owners engage in towing at almost equal rates, highlighting universal utility needs.

- **Fuel Savings by Household Type**: Couples with children enjoy the highest fuel savings, significantly more than single parents — possibly due to higher travel frequency and distances.

- **Charging Habits**: Purchase motivation (economic, environmental, etc.) does not significantly impact how often owners charge at home — indicating similar usage patterns across buyer types.

- **Trip Type Interaction**: Rural EV owners travel farther for private trips, whereas metro owners travel more for work — suggesting infrastructure planning should consider trip purpose as well as location.

- **Attitude Shift (2022–2023)**: EV owners showed increased support for public charging infrastructure over time — a sign of improving confidence and satisfaction with government efforts.
